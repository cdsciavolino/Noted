# Noted

### Overview
Using the same idea as [Coffee Note](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/CoffeeNote), *Noted* incorporates most of the same functionality as Coffee Note but using a third party framework [JTAppleCalendar](https://patchthecode.github.io) and in a more expandable way (i.e. not using storyboards). Currently, most of the functionality is still being implemented slowly but surely as *Noted* catches up to Coffee Note in complexity.

### Coming Soon
- Data pulled from the general data structure when selecting a current day from the month.
- Implement CoreData to persist the primary Date -> String map. 
- Implement CloudKit to hold data on the cloud in case of expansion to macOS or iPad.
- Add a to-do list to complement the calendar to maximize productivity.
- Add a table view for all of the data stored in the calendar.
